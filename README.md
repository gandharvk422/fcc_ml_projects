# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two folders, each housing distinct machine learning projects:

## 1. 100 Days 100 Projects

This folder is dedicated to 100 self-initiated machine learning projects undertaken over the course of 100 days. Each project is designed to explore various concepts, algorithms, and techniques within the field of machine learning. From classic algorithms to cutting-edge advancements, these projects aim to provide hands-on experience and foster a deeper understanding of machine learning principles.

## 2. FCC Machine Learning with Python Projects

This folder comprises 5 machine learning projects curated from FreeCodeCamp's curriculum on machine learning with Python. These projects are structured to cover fundamental machine learning concepts and practical applications using Python programming language. By completing these projects, learners gain practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more, as they progress through FreeCodeCamp's learning pathway.
