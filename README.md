# FCC Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, **fcc_ml_projects**. This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have completed as part of the *[FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/)* curriculum.

## About the Projects

These projects cover a wide range of machine learning concepts and techniques, providing a practical and hands-on approach to learning. Each project is self-contained, meaning you can view the code, run it, and see the results all within its own directory.

The projects in this repository includes:-
1. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/gandharvk422/fcc_ml_projects/tree/main/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors)
2. [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/gandharvk422/fcc_ml_projects/tree/main/Cat%20and%20Dog%20Image%20Classifier)
3. [Book Recommendation Engine using KNN](https://github.com/gandharvk422/fcc_ml_projects/tree/main/Book%20Recommendation%20Engine%20using%20KNN)
4. [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator](https://github.com/gandharvk422/fcc_ml_projects/tree/main/Linear%20Regression%20Health%20Costs%20Calculator)
5. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/gandharvk422/fcc_ml_projects/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors)

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository are implemented using various machine learning libraries and tools. Some of the key technologies used include:

- *Python:* The primary programming language used for implementing the machine learning algorithms.
- *Scikit-learn:* A powerful Python library for machine learning. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours.
- *Pandas:* A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
- *NumPy:* A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run.
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the Python script to see the output.
