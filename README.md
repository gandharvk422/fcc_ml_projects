# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two folders, each housing distinct machine learning projects:

## 1. FCC Machine Learning with Python Projects

This folder comprises 5 machine learning projects curated from FreeCodeCamp's curriculum on machine learning with Python. These projects are structured to cover fundamental machine learning concepts and practical applications using Python programming language. By completing these projects, learners gain practical experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more, as they progress through FreeCodeCamp's learning pathway.

## 2. Streamlit Projects
