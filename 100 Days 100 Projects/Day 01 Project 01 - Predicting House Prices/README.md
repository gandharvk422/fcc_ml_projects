# Day 01 Project 01 - Predicting House Prices

Welcome to the "Predicting House Prices" project! In this project, we explore two different approaches to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc. We have implemented two different models to accomplish this task: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.

## Folder Structure

- **<a href="100 Days 100 Projects/Day 01 Project 01 - Predicting House Prices/01. Using Linear Regression/">01. Using Linear Regression</a>**: This folder contains the code and resources related to predicting house prices using Linear Regression.
  
- **<a href="100 Days 100 Projects/Day 01 Project 01 - Predicting House Prices/02. Using Random Forest Regression/">02. Using Random Forest Regression</a>**: This folder contains the code and resources related to predicting house prices using Random Forest Regression.

## Getting Started

To get started with each approach, navigate to the respective folders and follow the instructions provided in the README files.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various houses including their features and corresponding prices. This dataset is available in each approach's folder.

## Dependencies

Both approaches require Python and common machine learning libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. Make sure to install these dependencies before running the code.
